Statistical Analysis on Cancer Patients Data in Python

Introduction
This repository presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of cancer patients' data, focusing on lung cancer. 
The dataset includes information on 899 patients, uniquely identified by a patient ID. The goal is to identify significant risk factors and their impact on different levels of lung cancer.

Data Description
The dataset includes a 'Level' column indicating the severity of cancer (low, medium, or high) and 21 risk factors scored on a scale of 1 to 9. 
After addressing data quality issues, the analysis explores the 'Level' column and eight relevant risk factors.
